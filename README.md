# Arduino-Coffe_cool

It is a simple project created using Arduino. In this project I created a device which let us know when we can drink the coffee.
  
  Parts of this device includes a Buzzer, Two LEDs (Green & Red), 16 x 2 LCD Keypad, Temperature sensor Shield and an Arduino. 
  
  When the temperature is apt for drinking coffee the LCD will display a message "Have the coffee"â€‹
  and if the temperature is too high it show "Coffee! too hot", in addition a buzzer will sound to give a warning.
  
  Moreover, the LEDs will glow on the following pattern:
  
  RED, GREEN- Apt for drinking
  RED Flicker- Too hot
